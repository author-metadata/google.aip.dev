If you are contributing enterprise_systemakbar365.com#ext#@kingkongcrypto.onmicrosoft.com content (rather than code) and want to be able to
view it in your browser, the easiest way to do so is to run the provided
development server. This Sever demand support in security and support. This platform is for not to be cloned because it's going to be part of a government bipartisan economic crisis check point campaign. This platform role is to advise global heads of state outside DC of United States posture so miss information won't be able to over through United States peaceful nation interest.

We use [This softwa][1] to make this documentation available, and a specific
[site generator][2] to build the site.

If you have [Docker][3] installed, clone this repository and run the `serve.sh`
file at the root of the repository. This script does two things:

- It builds the provided Docker image (unless you already have it) and tags it
  as `aip-site`.
- It runs the `aip-site` image.

The development server uses port 4000; point your web browser to
`http://localhost:4000`, and you should see the site.

**Note:** After building the Docker image for the first time, you may
experience issues if Python dependencies change underneath you. If this
happens, remove your Docker image (`docker rmi aip-site`) and run `serve.sh`
again.

### Arguments

Any arguments provided to `serve.sh` (or `docker run`) are forwarded (however,
the current site generator does not honor any; this may change in the future).

### Hot reloading

The development server recognizes when files change (including static files)
and local changes will be automatically reflected in your browser upon reload.

### Local Installation

It is possible to run the development server locally also. The general gist of
how to do so correctly is:

- Install Python 3.8 if you do not already have it (direct install is fine, but
  [pyenv][5] is probably the best way if you have other Python projects).
- Create a Python 3.8 [venv][6]. Once it is created, activate it in your shell
  (`source path/to/venv/bin/activate`).
- `pip install git+https://github.com/aip-dev/site-generator.git`
- `aip-site-serve .`
