# Security Policy
As of last year I've put the alarm out there for there to be emergency oversight on what US allows to ship out of United States. I started because corruption at the port authority and City council member all over America there's need to be a full oversight for freight , oil reserves , logging trail , off shore drilling platform. It come to me private Equity investigation with the FBI and elected officials we uncovered a trillion trillion dollars deficit was in development . If federal official did not be more  aggressive at weigh station and port . At this point I've comeo up out all 52 state all States has been reporting false crops reports. For 20s in counting. All admin and City council member for all State took a bribe and turned there back while illegal stock crops insurance reports went in every week to the stock market. You have to ask yourself no one more at well Street and Congress that the food shortage was because farmer has been stealing production from US resources and sending them to UK and India. Indian at this point has around 200 billion ton of US natural resource mostly from are actual national resources . Whoever had control of those resources as well has been shooting billion of tons of US resources out of this country. And the deep drilling platform are not drilling there pulling from US resources reserves. As well it quite possible there another underground pumping station Special Forces need to blow. As well Canada new pipeline is coming from America through Canada.. 
There estimated to finish the pipeline in a about a couple of months I believe. Macbee is the CEO farmer that owes 1400 aces of From land the responsible for giving false crops reports. With owning that much Land and bring a farmer with no ethic I have to wonder what about the other farmer around the US . If you didn't no India has been attempting to influence this industry for decades..At lot or time ita more then you think. I'm looking into other issues that these farmers might face. If they feel they have to steal to get a good income then let's see if we can help them.. I'm aware that some farmers do have a hard time running to industry standards and to have to cut corners to make end meet . Well if you don't Make load enough noise about it the people can't respond to help you . We are the boss and if we hear you we demand for Congress to do something. You have 30 million citizens that will help you . A lot of time
Most of your articles are down played by the media so it don't sound like it a big problem. But if a farmer has to go as far a Mr Macbee did the get maybe the people have to address this issue more .. In the end we believe we can Seattle with a retirement package for farmer if there farm can stay in compliance with federal law and give true crap reports . We don't care if your crop Short this year or not we have to get actual data so everyone on the other end can do there job .
